## Updates ##
* 0.0.5, 4/8/2014 - [@rufncrus](https://github.com/rufncrus) just made a change that was *SO* easy to do, but I always were too lazy to update it myself. Also I added s letters to http so it's now https. See, I'm *that* lazy! :smile:
* 0.0.4, ??/??/?? - this was my bad, sorry I'm new to versioning
* 0.0.3, 11/7/2014 - Bootstrap 3.1.1 to Bootstrap 3.2.0 & html5shiv.js also got a version bump to 3.7.2.
* 0.0.2, 25/5/2014 - I had some problems typing Bootstrap correctly, so there's that & removed the shortcut
* 0.0.1, 8/2/2014 - Initial release

## Directions ##
* File > New
* Then File > New Bootstrap 3 Document

This will make Bootstrap 3 Skeleton at cursor location.
